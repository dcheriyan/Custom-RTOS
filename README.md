# Custom-RTOS
Project to build an RTOS from scratch for a Cortex-M3 device.

Cool Features:

  **- Context Switching**

  **- FPP Scheduling**

  **- Semaphores**

  **- Mutexes**

Started by setting up Kernel,  TCBs and a Stack for each TCB.
Then implemented a task creation function.
Next, implemented Context switching to go between tasks.
Then added FPP scehduling based on priority of tasks.
After added semaphores and mutexes, as well as test cases for these.

Starter code was provided my prof for Intro: Computer Structures & Real-Time Operating Systems, Andrew Morton.
